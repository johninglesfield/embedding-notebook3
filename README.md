# embedding-notebook3
This notebook gives examples of transport in nanostructures using the embedding method, and includes some of the topics
discussed in chapter 7 of "The Embedding Method for Electronic Structure".
It uses the following Python modules, Numpy, Matplotlib, and Cmath, as well as the transport.py module in the repository,
which itself uses Numpy, Scipy, and Cmath.
